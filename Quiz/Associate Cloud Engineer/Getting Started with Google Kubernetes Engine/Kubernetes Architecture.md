10.
You have deployed a new Kubernetes Engine regional cluster with four machines in the default pool for the first zone and left the number of zones at the default. How many Compute Engine machines are deployed and billed against your account?

A. Fifteen. (Four nodes and a single control plane are deployed to each of the three zones. A control plane node is deployed in each zone and it is billed against your account.)
_Feedback: Review the lesson on GKE Concepts._

B. Sixteen. (Four nodes are deployed in primary and secondary zones in two regions, for a total of 4 zones and 16 nodes. A control plane node is deployed in each zone but it is not billed to your account.)

C. Ten. (Four nodes are deployed in the first zone and three nodes are deployed in two other zones because you selected the defaults.)
_Feedback: Review the lesson on GKE Concepts._

**D. Twelve. (Four nodes are deployed in each of three zones. A control plane node is deployed in each zone which is indirectly billed against your account through the cluster management fee.)**


11.
In a manifest file for a Pod, in which field do you define a container image for the Pod?

A. apiVersion
_Feedback: ApiVersion describes which Kubernetes API version is used to create the object._

B. kind
_Feedback: Kind tells Kubernetes which object we want._

C. metadata
_Feedback: The metadata helps identify an object by supplying it with a name and one or more labels._

**D. spec**


12.
What are Kubernetes namespaces useful for? Choose all that are correct (2 correct answers).

**A. Namespaces allow you to use object names that would otherwise be duplicates of one another.**
_Correct._

**B. Namespaces let you implement resource quotas across your cluster.**
_Correct._

C. Namespaces make resources more secure.
_Feedback: By themselves, using namespaces does not increase security._

D. Namespaces partition Linux kernel resources.
_Feedback: Linux namespaces are not the same as Kubernetes namespaces._


13.
What is the purpose of the Deployment object?

A. To ensure that a defined set of Pods is running at any given time.
_Correct._

B. To launch one or more Pods and ensure that a specified number of them successfully run to completion and exit.
_Feedback: This option describes a Kubernetes Job._

C. To launch one or more Pods on a time-based schedule.
_Feedback: This option describes a Kubernetes CronJob._


14.

_Incorrect._

B. Deployment
_Incorrect._

C. ReplicaSet
_Incorrect._

**D. StatefulSet**
_Correct._


15.
You need to ensure that the production applications running on your Kubernetes cluster are not impacted by test and staging deployments. Which features should you implement and configure to ensure that the resources for your production applications can be prioritized?

A. Configure labels for Test, Staging and Production and configure specific Kubernetes resource quotas for the Production Namespace.
_Feedback: Review the lesson on Kubernetes Object Management._

B. Configure Namespaces for Test, Staging and Production and configure specific Kubernetes resource quotas for the Production Namespace.
_Feedback: Review the lesson on Kubernetes Object Management._

**C. Configure Namespaces for Test, Staging and Production and configure specific Kubernetes resource quotas for the test and staging Namespaces.**
_Feedback: Resource quotas are used to limit usage in specific Namespaces, and do not need to be configured for all Namespaces, only those you need to limit._

D. Configure resource requests for Test, Staging and Production and configure specific Kubernetes resource quotas for the Production Namespace.
_Feedback: Review the lesson on Kubernetes Object Management._


16.
When configuring storage for stateful applications, what steps must you take to provide file system storage inside your containers for data from your applications that will not be lost or deleted if your Pods fail or are deleted for any reason?
